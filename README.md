# remix-on-app-engine
Let's take advantage of App Engine features with a Remix app.
The `Express.js`, `Fastify` and `Remix App Server` deployment targets should all work well.

We can build on the great work from NickFoden in 
[remix-app-server-gae](https://github.com/NickFoden/remix-app-server-gae) and
[starter-express-app-engine](https://github.com/NickFoden/starter-express-app-engine).

We can also start with [Google Cloud Datastore: Node.js Client](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-datastore)
and look into putting another database abstraction on top.
